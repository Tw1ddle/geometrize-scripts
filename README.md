This is a collection of ChaiScript scripts for [Geometrize](https://www.geometrize.co.uk/), a tool for geometrizing images into geometric primitives.

These scripts are useful for customizing the behaviour of the Geometrize software, as well as a starting point to writing and adapting your own.

## Usage Examples

Start by downloading the scripts somewhere on your local drive.

 * Scripts can be run by invoking Geometrize from the command line with the --script parameter, followed by the path to the script.
 * Embedded script consoles can run scripts through the runScript(path, params) calls.
 * Scripts that do not require parameters can be drag-dropped onto the Geometrize launch window, or via the "run script" button in the launch window.
 * Scripts for customizing shape mutation can be modified through the scripting panel, which is available for each image to be geometrized.
